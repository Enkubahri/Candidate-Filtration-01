# Implementation Summary: Required Education Certification Feature

## Overview
Successfully implemented the `required_education_certification` field to the candidate filtration system. This optional field allows administrators to specify educational certification or field of study requirements when creating job criteria.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`app.py`)
- Added database migration in `init_db()` to create the `required_education_certification` column in the `criteria` table
- Column is TEXT type with default value of empty string for backward compatibility

### 2. Form Classes (`app.py`)
- **AdminCriteriaForm**: Added `required_education_certification` StringField with placeholder text
- **EditJobForm**: Added `required_education_certification` StringField with placeholder text
- Both forms include helpful placeholder text: "e.g., Computer Science, Engineering, Business Administration, etc."

### 3. Database Operations (`app.py`)
- **add_job() function**: Updated to include `required_education_certification` in database inserts
- **edit_job() function**: Updated to include `required_education_certification` in database updates and form pre-population
- Includes backward compatibility checks for databases without the new column

### 4. Template Updates
- **templates/add_job.html**: Added form field with proper Bootstrap styling and help text
- **templates/edit_job.html**: Added form field with proper Bootstrap styling and help text
- Field appears right after the "Minimum Education Level" dropdown as requested

### 5. Form Validation & User Experience
- Field is optional (no required validators)
- Includes helpful placeholder text to guide admins
- Form validation errors are properly displayed
- Field is properly integrated with existing form styling

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE criteria ADD COLUMN required_education_certification TEXT DEFAULT ""
```

### Form Field Definition
```python
required_education_certification = StringField(
    'Required Education Certification/Field of Study',
    validators=[],
    render_kw={'placeholder': 'e.g., Computer Science, Engineering, Business Administration, etc.'}
)
```

### Template Integration
The field appears in the admin forms with proper Bootstrap styling:
```html
<div class="mb-3">
    {{ form.required_education_certification.label(class="form-label") }}
    {{ form.required_education_certification(class="form-control") }}
    <div class="form-text">Specify field of study or certification required (optional)</div>
</div>
```

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing databases are automatically migrated when `init_db()` runs
- Code includes checks for column existence before performing operations
- Default empty string value ensures no disruption to existing records

## Testing Status
- ✅ Database schema migration works correctly
- ✅ Column is created with proper specifications (TEXT, default empty string)
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ Forms can be accessed through web interface
- ✅ Field appears in both Add Job and Edit Job forms

## Usage
Administrators can now:
1. Navigate to Admin → Manage Jobs → Add Job
2. Fill in the "Required Education Certification/Field of Study" field (optional)
3. Save the job criteria with the certification requirement
4. Edit existing jobs to add or modify certification requirements

The field is positioned right under the "Minimum Education Level" dropdown as requested, making it intuitive for administrators to specify both the education level and the specific field of study or certification needed.
