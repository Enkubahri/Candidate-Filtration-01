# Vercel Deployment Guide for Candidate Filtration System

## 🚨 Important Notice

**Vercel has significant limitations for Flask applications with databases.** This guide provides solutions, but consider alternative platforms for full functionality.

## ❓ Why Did You Get a 404 Error?

The 404 error on Vercel typically occurs because:

1. **Flask app not properly configured** for serverless deployment
2. **Missing vercel.json** configuration file
3. **Dependencies not compatible** with Vercel's serverless environment
4. **Database issues** - SQLite doesn't work well on Vercel

## ✅ Solutions Provided

### **Solution 1: Standalone API (Recommended for Vercel)**

I've created `api/standalone.py` - a simplified version that works with Vercel's limitations:

**Features:**
- ✅ Works on Vercel serverless
- ✅ No database dependencies
- ✅ Demo data for testing
- ✅ All API endpoints working
- ❌ No persistent data storage
- ❌ No file uploads
- ❌ No full application features

### **Solution 2: Fixed Original API**

Updated `api/index.py` with Vercel compatibility, but with limitations due to database requirements.

## 🔧 Files Created for Vercel

1. **`vercel.json`** - Vercel configuration
2. **`api/standalone.py`** - Standalone API without database
3. **`api/requirements-vercel.txt`** - Minimal dependencies
4. **Updated `api/requirements.txt`** - Vercel-optimized

## 🚀 Quick Fix for Your 404 Error

The standalone API should work immediately. Try these endpoints:

- **Health Check:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/health`
- **API Info:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/version`
- **Demo Candidates:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/candidates`
- **Statistics:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/stats`

## 🏆 Better Deployment Alternatives
